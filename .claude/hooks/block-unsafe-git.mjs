// tool call), so your escape hatch survives. Server-side branch protection stays the
// real boundary. The rule logic itself is pure and unit-tested — see blockReason() in
// scripts/lib/unsafe-git.mjs; this file is just the stdin/stderr/exit-code shell, plus the
// one fact only a shell can supply: whether the call's working directory is the root checkout
// (scripts/lib/checkout-context.mjs asks git), which the integration-checkout rule needs.

  // security boundary (server-side branch protection is). So stay open, but SAY SO: the old

// unsafe-git.mjs — the pure decision logic behind .claude/hooks/block-unsafe-git.mjs and
// .codex/hooks/block-unsafe-git.mjs (the PreToolUse(Bash) guards). Extracted so the rules get unit
// test coverage; each hook stays a thin stdin/stderr/exit-code shell around blockReason().
//
// Ten plain rules, judged on the actual command segments of an agent's shell call:
//   git commit --no-verify   -> skips the pre-commit gates
//   git push --no-verify     -> skips the lint pre-push hook
//   git -c core.hooksPath=… / git --config-env core.hooksPath=… /
//   GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>=core.hooksPath / GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS=…'core.hooksPath=…'…
//                            -> points git at other hooks for that command, so the commit, merge
//                                and push hooks are skipped; refused on any git subcommand and
//                                whatever the value
//   git config core.hooksPath <other than .githooks> / --unset / unset
//                            -> disarms the hooks for every later command in the repository, its
//                                worktrees included; only the arming step and a read that ends at
//                                the key pass
//   git push --force / -f    -> unsafe overwrite (--force-with-lease is ALLOWED)
//   git filter-branch        -> history rewrite
//   gh pr create (no --draft)-> skips the draft review before the metered suite
//   gh pr merge              -> only `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch <number>`, alone
//                                in its segment, is allowed: an admin token merges regardless of
//                                checks, and --auto lets GitHub merge only once the required test
//                                check is green
//   gh pr ready              -> only `gh pr ready <number>`, with or without --undo, alone in its
//                                segment, is allowed
//   git commit / checkout / switch / branch <new> / merge (not --ff-only) / cherry-pick / revert /
//   rebase / am in the root checkout
//                            -> the root is the integration checkout: it stays on main and
//                                nothing is branched, switched, or committed there; a job runs in
//                                a linked worktree. Judged only when the hook passes
//                                `checkout` ({ cwd, isRootCheckout(dir), platform }, resolved in
//                                scripts/lib/checkout-context.mjs); `git switch main`,
//                                `git branch -d`, pulls, and worktree upkeep stay allowed
//
// Quoted spans and heredoc bodies are data, not invocations, and are blanked before the rules look,
// so a commit message or pull request body that mentions `--force` or `--draft` trips nothing. A
// backslash-escaped character outside single quotes is a character and nothing more: an escaped
// quote opens and closes no span and an escaped `<` opens no heredoc, so neither can turn a live
// command into data. The guard reads the command text with regular expressions and does not
// tokenise it, and it does not look inside a shell wrapper, a command substitution, or an `env -S`
// string. A plain `env` prefix is the one wrapper it reads: `env`, then any of `-i`, `-`,
// `--ignore-environment`, `--`, `-u NAME`, `-uNAME`, `--unset=NAME` or `--unset NAME`, where NAME
// is letters, digits and underscores, then `NAME=value` words, then git, is judged as the git
// command it runs by every git rule, the root-checkout rule included. Any other `env` form (`-S`,
// `-C`, `--chdir`, joined short options, an unset name of any other shape, an option after an
// assignment, a whole quoted assignment, a second `env`) is not read, and `env` in front of `cd`
// or `gh pr create` is not read either. The guard is an accident-catcher for an agent's own
// plainly written tool calls, not a security boundary. Server-side branch protection is the
// boundary, and a manual command in your own terminal is not a tool call, so your escape hatch
// survives.
// The `gh pr merge` and `gh pr ready` rules are the exception: the allow rules in
// `.claude/settings.json` run those prefixes unprompted, so these two rules bound what the prefixes
// admit and fail closed on any segment that invokes either and that they cannot fully read (a
// quoted word, the command words `gh`, `pr`, `merge` and `ready` included, a variable, a command
// substitution, a redirection, a wrapper, an assignment prefix, -R/--repo, a path-qualified or
// capitalised `gh`). They also read four shapes the other rules leave alone: an invocation glued to
// a lone `&` or `|&`, one that follows a shell comment or arithmetic holding a `<<word` or a quote
// character, one in a command substitution inside a double-quoted span, where a backslash-escaped
// `$(` or backtick is text and opens or closes nothing, and one whose `gh`, `pr`, `merge` or
// `ready` word is quoted, which is seen and refused even when the rest of the segment is the
// delivery form. Residuals, none of which matches the two `gh` allow rules: a `sh -c` or other
// wrapper string is not looked inside, a substitution that carries a heredoc inside double quotes
// is not read, and a quoted capitalised or path-qualified name and a partly quoted or
// backslash-escaped command word are not unquoted, and a `$(…)` inside double quotes whose closing
// `)` is hidden by a nested quote, a `case` pattern or an unbalanced literal `)` is read only to
// that early `)`, so an invocation after it is not seen. One residual does run unprompted: the
// working directory is not judged, so a delivery form after a `cd`, in the same command or an
// earlier call, passes, and `gh` acts on the repository that directory belongs to, which is another
// repository only where one sits inside the session's working directories. The environment is not
// judged either: after an `export` of `GH_REPO`, `GH_HOST`, `GH_TOKEN` or `GH_CONFIG_DIR` in the
// same command a delivery form passes, and `gh` acts on the repository or account the variable
// names. The allow rules do not cover the `export`, so they do not run that command unprompted. An
// ANSI-C `$'…'` span is paired as a plain single-quoted one, so a `\'` inside it ends the span
// early for the guard, and a command between it and the next `'` is read as quoted data and not
// seen. The segment walk does not read a backslash. An escaped `;` or `|`, a backslash-newline and
// an escaped blank in an assignment value each end a segment or a value for it, so a `--force` or
// `--no-verify` after one (`git push origin HEAD \` with the flag on the next line, `git commit -m
// a\;b --no-verify`) is not seen by the git rules, a `--draft` on a continuation line is not seen
// by the create rule, which refuses, and the merge and ready rules refuse the cut segment. A
// backslash-newline between the command words themselves (`gh pr \` then `merge`, `git \` then
// `push --force`) hides the invocation from every rule, and whether such a command then runs
// unprompted depends on how the runtime matches a continued command against the allow rules, which
// the guard does not control. A `#` straight after a closing `)` is not read as a comment, because
// after a substitution (`$(…)#`) it is a character; after a subshell it is a comment, so a
// `<<word` or a quote character in it (`(cmd)# <<word`) is read as an operator or a span and the
// lines up to its pairing are not seen. Arithmetic is one `((` to the next `))` with no depth, so a
// nested `))` ends it early and a shift after it (`$(( ((1)) << word ))`) is read as a heredoc
// operator. In both, the unseen line can be one the `gh pr ready` allow rule matches.
// Executable names (git, gh) are matched case-insensitively: this repository lives on a
// case-insensitive volume, so `Git push --force` runs the real binary. Only the name is widened;
// subcommands and flags stay exact (`git COMMIT` is not a command, `-F` is not `-f`), and `cd` stays
// lowercase because a capitalised `CD` runs /usr/bin/cd in a child process and moves nothing.
// The hooks-path rule reads four carriers of the setting: `-c core.hooksPath=<value>` and
// `--config-env core.hooksPath=<variable>` (or `--config-env=…`) among a git invocation's own
// options, before the subcommand; the word `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>=core.hooksPath` anywhere in a
// segment, so an `export`, an `env` prefix and a command that names no git are read too; and an
// assignment of `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`, the variable git uses to hand `-c` to its own child
// processes, one of whose entries has the key as its complete key. Git takes the payload as a
// blank-separated list of single-quoted entries (`'key=value'`, `'key'` or `'key'='value'`), so
// the key counts only in an entry's key position: straight after a single quote that opens the
// payload or follows a blank, and straight before a `=` or a single quote. A longer key
// (`core.hooksPathology`), a value that mentions the key
// (`'alias.hooks=config --get core.hooksPath'`) and a value that is the quoted key
// (`'user.name'='core.hooksPath'`) pass. A payload written outside quotes has each of its single
// quotes and blanks backslash-escaped (`GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS=\'core.hooksPath\'=\'/dev/null\'`)
// and is read by the same key position. Git reads the key in any letter case, so the rule does,
// and the two environment names are read in any letter case too, because Git for Windows reads
// them so; `-c` stays exact, because `-C` is a directory.
// A redirection glued to the key word (`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=core.hooksPath>/dev/null`) ends it as a
// blank does. The value is not judged: no tool call needs the override, and the arming step
// `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` is a different command.
// Quoting hides none of the usual spellings. A quoted span that is the key alone, or the key and
// its value, keeps the key. One quoted span straight after `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS=` that holds such
// an entry keeps the key. The whole value word of a `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` assignment is also read
// as the shell hands it to git, before anything else is rewritten: its quoted spans,
// backslash-escaped characters and bare characters are joined up to the first unquoted blank or
// operator, so a payload split across several quoted pieces (`"'"core.hooksPath=/dev/null"'"`) is
// read as the one payload it is, and a word that holds such an entry keeps the key. A quoted span
// that is a whole assignment (`"GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=core.hooksPath"`,
// `"GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS='core.hooksPath=…'"`) is refused when its segment holds `export`,
// `declare`, `typeset` or `env` before it, and is a mention otherwise (`echo`, `grep`). Refused
// with the rule although harmless: an unquoted mention of either environment word (`grep
// GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=core.hooksPath`), so quote the mention, an unquoted mention whose payload is
// split across quoted pieces, as the single-span mention is, a malformed payload git itself rejects
// whose joined word still holds the entry (`"'core.hooksPath=x'"extra`), and a quoted whole
// assignment used as plain text after one of those four words. An empty `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS=`
// and one whose entries have other keys pass. Not refused, because git itself rejects them: a glued
// `-ccore.hooksPath=…` and a `-c core.hooksPath` with no `=`. Not refused, because the repository's
// own armed setting outranks them: `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`. Residuals: a key or
// a payload behind a variable or a substitution (`-c "$KEY=…"`, `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS=$P`), a
// partly quoted or backslash-escaped key, name, option or assignment outside the value word of a
// `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` assignment (`core."hooksPath"`, `"GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0"=core.hooksPath`, `-c
// core.hooksPath"=/dev/null"`, `-c core.hooks\Path=/dev/null`, `"-c" core.hooksPath=/dev/null`), a
// payload written as an ANSI-C `$'…'` span, a configuration file that carries the key (`-c
// include.path=<file>`) and a shell alias given by `-c alias.<name>=!…` whose body carries the
// override are not read; and an option carrier on a git that is subshelled, substituted, or wrapped
// by anything but a plain `env` prefix is not seen, as a `--no-verify` there is not.
// An edit of the configuration file itself, a `git config --edit`, and a `git config` that removes
// or renames the whole `core` section are not judged.
// The `git config` rule reads the words after `config`. When one of them is the key, the command
// passes only as a read (no word follows the key), as the arming step (the word after the key is
// `.githooks`, unquoted), or when its own key is read as another setting, as described below; every
// other unset form is refused. A word after the key is refused even when it looks like an option,
// because the older syntax stores it as the value: `git config core.hooksPath --get` sets the hooks
// path to `--get`. Put options before the key. The command's own key is read when the text after
// `config` is readable as written, character by character. Blanks are spaces and tabs. The words
// are an optional first word `set`, `unset` or `get`; then only these options, spelled in full:
// `--global`, `--system`, `--local`, `--worktree`, `--get`, `--get-all`, `--add`, `--replace-all`,
// `--unset`, `--unset-all`, `--all`, `--fixed-value`, and `-f`, `--file`, `--type`, `--default` and
// `--value`, each with a plain word, the long ones also glued with `=`; then a plain dotted key;
// then plain words that do not start with a dash; then, at the end only, plain redirections (`>`,
// `>>` or `<` with a plain target, one descriptor digit allowed) and a comment. A plain word is
// letters, digits and `_ . / : @ + , -`; a quoted span that is exactly the key counts as the key.
// When the command's key is another setting the command passes, although it names `core.hooksPath`
// as a value, a pattern or an option's value: `git config --unset user.name core.hooksPath` unsets
// `user.name`. Anything else is not read and keeps the refusal: an abbreviated or unlisted option,
// any other quoted word, a backslash, a variable, a glob, a word after the key that starts with a
// dash, an ampersand, a parenthesis, a descriptor copy (`2>&1`), a here-string, any other blank
// character anywhere in the command, and any command in which a quoted `gh`, `pr`, `merge` or
// `ready` was unquoted, because that reading leaves a blank where the shell joins two pieces. The
// scope is not judged, so a `--global` write is refused although the repository's own armed setting
// outranks it. A redirection is not a word, whether a blank precedes it or it is glued to the word
// before it (`core.hooksPath>/dev/null`), and neither is a trailing comment, so a read followed by
// either passes. A backslash-escaped blank does not end a word, so a redirection target that holds
// one (`>/tmp/my\ log`) is one target, and a `#` after it starts no comment. An abbreviated
// `--unset-all` (`--unset-a`, `--unset-al`) is an unset, because git takes a unique prefix of a
// long option.

  // so an apostrophe in a body cannot poison it, and it queues the operators on one line so
  // `cat <<A <<B` consumes A's body then B's. The terminator test tolerates surrounding blanks and a
  // trailing \r, because a body left visible is the false-block this pass exists to prevent.
  // A backslash outside single quotes is copied together with the character it escapes and the pair
  // is read as nothing: an escaped quote toggles no quote state, an escaped `#` starts no comment,
  // an escaped `<` opens no pairing, an escaped `(` or `)` opens or closes no arithmetic, and an
  // escaped newline does not end the operator line, so the body starts after the next unescaped
  // one. Inside single quotes a backslash is a character and the next `'` closes the span. A shell
  // comment keeps its `#` and loses its text up to the newline, and a `<<` between `((` and `))` is
  // an arithmetic shift, so neither opens a pairing or a quoted span. A `#` starts a comment only at
  // the start of a word, which `startsWord` judges on the text already copied: after a
  // backslash-escaped blank or operator it continues the word and the rest of the line stays live.

  // git for, so it passes `checkout` and any caller passing nothing is not judged. The walk carries a
  // SET of candidate directories across segments, and refuses branch work if any of them is the
  // root: a `cd` chained with `&&` replaces the set (a failed cd stops the chain), one chained with
  // `;`, a newline, or `||` adds to it (a failed cd leaves the shell where it was and the chain runs
  // on), and one behind `|` moves nothing (a pipeline subshell). `git -C <path>` moves one
  // invocation. So `cd <worktree> && git commit` from the root stays allowed, `cd <root> && git
  // commit` from a worktree is refused, and `cd <gone>; git commit` from the root is refused too.
  // Branch work is commit, checkout, switch, a `git branch` that names a branch without deleting
  // or listing, and the other writers of commits onto the current branch: merge (a fast-forward-only
  // merge is the pull's own shape and stays allowed), cherry-pick, revert, rebase, am. The lone
  // switch allowed is to `main`, the only branch the root may hold, which is how closeout and the
  // sweep restore it; `-q`, `--no-guess`, the other read-only switch options, and a redirection
  // around it are decoration, and any other option (`-b`, `--detach`, `--`, …) is not.
  // Fail-OPEN residuals, named: a target the guard cannot resolve (`cd` alone, `cd -`, `~`, a
  // variable, a blanked span) is an unknown candidate the walk cannot judge, though the known ones
  // beside it still are, and --git-dir/--work-tree on the invocation makes the invocation unknown;
  // `pushd` and a backslash-escaped space in a path are not modelled. On Windows a path is read as Git
  // Bash reads it, the shell Claude Code's Bash tool runs there: `/c/...` is drive C:, and any other
  // single-slash rooted path is an unresolved target, since Git Bash maps it to a folder the walk
  // cannot name (its install folder, or the user's temp folder for `/tmp`). PowerShell reads a rooted
  // path against the current drive instead; no PowerShell command reaches the guard yet, and the Codex
  // hook would hand one the same win32 context, so #1471 and #1480 own reading it as PowerShell does.
  // Fail-CLOSED residuals: a parenthesised `(cd x && …)` never relocates, because nothing would
  // restore the directory when the subshell closes, so the whole command is judged where it started;
  // `cd x || exit 1; git commit` keeps the old directory as a candidate although the exit would have
  // taken it, and so does `cd <root>; cd <worktree>; git commit`, because a `;`-chained cd is never
  // known to have succeeded. All are visible and recoverable: chain with `&&`.

// factory-sync.mjs — read and verify the factory manifest, `.agents/factory-manifest.json`: the shared

//
//   { path, sha256[, executable: true] }         a regular file, hashed over its bytes; executable marks git mode
//                                                100755 and is absent for 100644
//   { path, region: 'factory-shared', sha256 }   the text strictly between the file's two region marker lines
//
// Every path is relative, POSIX and free of `.`, `..` and empty segments, and is checked before any read. A `.git`
// segment in any letter case is refused too: it would name a file inside a repository's own git directory, where
// the status check and the tree listings see nothing. A path holding a backslash is refused too: Windows reads it
// as a separator, so `..\x` would climb out of the tree.
// Disk state is read with lstat, so a symlink or directory where a file is expected is drift, never followed. The
// executable bit is read from the disk, except where the checkout does not honour file modes (core.fileMode false,
// as on Windows), whose disk cannot hold that bit: there it is read from git's index.
// No two paths name the same file on a case-insensitive or Unicode-normalising disk, and no path lies under another.
// Every malformed input throws with a named cause.
//
// No manifest lists the seat settings file, SETTINGS_PATH in runtimes.mjs, in any letter case or Unicode form,
// nor a path under it: that file is the repository's own. A manifest may hold `seatDefaults`, the shared value of
// each seat setting its repository overrides, in the nested form of the settings file's `seats` and naming only
// seat files the same manifest lists.
//
// A tree's settings file may name the runtimes it runs; runtimes.mjs says which entry belongs to which runtime. An
// entry of a runtime the settings file leaves out is left out of the tree: every manifest keeps every entry, a sync
// writes only the entries of the named runtimes, and the path of a left-out entry must hold nothing. A tree with no
// settings file, or one that names no runtimes, runs both and leaves nothing out.
//
// verifyManifest reports anything a left-out entry's path holds, whatever its bytes, and nothing where it holds
// nothing. It holds every other entry to its record, with one exception: a seat the tree's settings file or the
// manifest's seatDefaults names. Such a seat verifies only when the settings named for it are the settings
// seatDefaults records for it, putting the recorded defaults back gives the bytes the entry records, and the values
// put back replaced the named ones; so its file is the shared bytes with exactly the named values in place and
// nothing else. seatDefaults is a witness the entry's hash checks, never trusted input. The settings file is read
// only as a regular file under no symlinked directory, and it and seatDefaults throw when malformed or when they
// name a seat the manifest does not list. A tree with neither takes the strict path alone, and a missing or changed
// file of a named runtime is refused like any other.
//
// syncInto copies the entries from a canonical source checkout into an adopter target. Everything it writes comes
// from the source's freshly fetched origin main commit, never from the source's working tree, index or disk
// manifest, and every git call ignores inherited repository-scoped variables such as GIT_DIR and GIT_INDEX_FILE.
// It validates everything before it writes or removes anything, so every refusal leaves the target untouched: the
// target's committed manifest, when HEAD's tree lists one, is read and validated like any other, and a HEAD that
// cannot be listed or a manifest that cannot be read is refused, never taken for a first sync; the canonical
// comes from the target's committed manifest or, only when there is none, the caller, and the fetched manifest
// names it too, in any letter case; the source's origin is that canonical and the target's is not; the source's
// HEAD is the fetched commit; source and target are clean at every shared path, so the source's uncommitted edits
// are refused loudly rather than silently left out, and the target's are never overwritten; the fetched commit
// matches its own manifest in kind, mode and content; no existing directory on an entry's path in the target is a
// symlink, even one pointing inside the target, so every write lands at its manifest path and never through a
// symlink; each region file, in the commit and as a regular file in the target, carries well-formed region
// markers; and the target's settings file, read from its working tree as verifyManifest reads it, names only seats
// the fetched manifest shares, only settings each of those seats carries, and no value that gives a seat a problem
// its fetched bytes do not have. The agent check and the seat policy that judge that are the ones of the copy
// running the sync, never the fetched commit's, and no file of the fetched commit is executed or imported, so a
// default this copy does not know stops nothing and a named value it does not know is refused. It then writes each
// file the target installs with the commit's bytes and mode, a seat the settings file names with the named values in place of the
// commit's, and each region between the target's own markers, and records the commit's manifest, with the target's
// canonical, plus `syncedFrom`, the fetched commit, and, when the settings file names any, `seatDefaults`, the
// commit's value of each setting it replaced. It never writes or removes the settings file, and a `seatDefaults`
// in the fetched manifest is never applied or copied. On a target that does not honour file modes the sync stages
// the file entries it writes, because the index is the only place such a checkout can hold the executable bit.
//
// A retired entry is one the target's committed manifest lists at a path the fetched manifest does not. The target
// must be clean at every retired path too, and before any write the sync removes each retired file it can prove: a
// regular file under no symlinked parent whose bytes, on disk and committed at the target's HEAD, are the ones that
// manifest recorded. A retired path the target's index marks skip-worktree or assume-unchanged is refused by name
// whatever it holds, even nothing: git status reports no change there, and a commit would not record the removal.
// Any other retired path holding nothing is left alone; anything else there, a retired region, or a retired path
// that a case-insensitive or Unicode-normalising disk reads as one the fetched manifest shares, is refused by name.
// It removes no directory and no other file.
//
// An entry of a runtime the target's settings file leaves out is never written, and the manifest the sync records
// still lists it. Its path is proven and cleared as a retired path is, against the record of the target's committed
// manifest where that lists the path and of the fetched manifest otherwise: a file committed with exactly those bytes
// is removed, a path holding nothing is skipped, and anything else is refused by name before any write, so a
// left-out seat that still holds overridden values is rendered back or removed first. The sync returns how many
// entries it left out.
//
// renderSettings applies the settings file of a tree to its seats between syncs, leaving the seats and the manifest
// as a sync would for the settings file as it stands. It reads no commit and needs no network. Every check runs
// before any write, so every refusal leaves the tree untouched: the manifest is a regular file under no symlinked
// directory, checked on its own before it is read; the tree's origin is not the manifest's canonical, whose seat
// lines are the defaults, while a tree with no origin proceeds; the settings file is read as verifyManifest reads
// it; and each seat the settings file or seatDefaults names is a regular file under no symlinked directory whose
// bytes, with its recorded defaults put back, are the bytes its entry records, so a seat changed outside its setting
// lines is refused by name and never overwritten, and whose named values give it no problem those shared bytes do
// not have. A recorded default of a seat whose runtime the settings file leaves out is skipped, its file neither
// read nor written, and dropped from the record. It then writes each seat whose bytes change, keeping its mode, and rewrites the manifest only when its
// bytes change: every top-level key it held in the order it held them, `syncedFrom` among them, with `seatDefaults`
// directly before `entries` and left out when no seat is overridden. It returns the seats it wrote and whether it
// rewrote the manifest, so a settings file whose values equal the shared defaults, which changes the manifest alone,
// is told from a run that wrote nothing. A second run writes nothing.
//
// checkLag compares this repository's manifest on disk with the canonical's manifest on main, never
// the working-tree files (local file drift is the workflow contract test's job). It ignores `syncedFrom` and
// compares `canonical`, `adopters` and each entry by path: only on main is "missing here", only here is "no
// longer shared", and a different kind, hash or executable bit is "changed", one line each, sorted by
// path. The state is 'in-sync' only when nothing differs, 'drifted' when something does, and 'unknown', with its
// cause, whenever the answer cannot be known: no or a malformed local manifest, a failed fetch, or a canonical
// manifest that fails the same validation as a local one. Unknown is never reported as in sync.

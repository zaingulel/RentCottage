// An HTML page in the may-edit column is judged by a third rule. A browser loads it raw, with no
// sanitizer between the file and the reader, so everything but free text is live and only free text
// may change. The page's skeleton is its own source with every free text chunk deleted; every other
// byte stays verbatim, so a tag, an attribute, a comment, a close tag the parser drops because nothing
// it names is open, and a self-closing rewrite all change it, while text edited, deleted, written into
// an empty element or moved across a tag does not. Inside `ontext`, `endIndex` is the chunk's last
// source offset, inclusive, and with entities left undecoded the chunk is the verbatim source, so its
// length locates its start. `startIndex` does not: after an end tag carrying anything before its `>`
// (`</p >`), it points at those bytes. Text the document ends on arrives in `ontext` too, before
// `onend`. In ordinary text a `<` always starts a new chunk, and raw text arrives whole, so every
// tag-open shape sits inside one chunk. A chunk is free unless a
// `script` or `style` is open anywhere above it (a browser ignores `/>` on either, so a `<script/>`
// makes everything after it code until `</script>`), or its bytes carry the tag-open shape, which is
// text only to the parser (a title's raw text ending at `</title/`, markup inside an SVG title), or it
// comes after a `<!--` inside a script, or after a `script` or `style` the parser closed by implication.
// Those two cases fail closed where the parser ends code before a browser does. From `<!--` a browser
// does not end the script at the first `</script>` after a nested `<script>`. A browser also keeps a
// `<script/>` or `<style/>` open until its own end tag, where the parser lets another element's end tag
// or the end of the page close it. The parser also closes an SVG `<script/>` by implication, which a
// browser leaves empty, so text after one is refused too: a deliberate over-refusal that fails safe.
// Entities stay undecoded, so `&lt;` is text and `<` is not.

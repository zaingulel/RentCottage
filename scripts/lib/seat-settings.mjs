// seat-settings.mjs — the seat settings file and the substitution of a seat's setting values.
//
// Pure: no file system, no git. The imports are the agent check, whose bound an override must keep, and runtimes.mjs,
// which owns the file's top-level rules so every reader of the file applies them. Reading, verifying and writing the
// files is for the sync, which imports this module; the settings file is read only by runtimes.mjs.
//
// SETTINGS FILE: SETTINGS_PATH (runtimes.mjs), version 1. Each runtime's own setting names are used:
//   { "version": 1, "runtimes": ["claude", "codex"], "seats": { "claude": { "builder": { "model": "opus", "effort": "high", "maxTurns": 120 } },
//                              "codex": { "reviewer": { "model_reasoning_effort": "high" } } } }
//
// Every rule below is a refusal that names the file, the place in it and the offending value (printed through
// JSON.stringify), raised before any file is written. Where a rule says "with the recovery", the refusal ends with
// this sentence, because the cause may be a file written for a newer copy of the workflow than the one installed:
//   if a newer copy of the shared workflow admits this, undo the edit, run the sync that installs that copy, then make the edit again
//
//  1. The file is a regular file reached through no symlinked directory, read without following a symlink,
//     holding one JSON object with the keys `version` and `seats` and, optionally, `runtimes`. `version` is exactly
//     1; any other version is refused as unsupported by this copy, with the recovery. Another key is refused with
//     the recovery.
//  2. `seats` is an object whose only keys are `claude` and `codex`, each an object from seat name to an object of
//     settings. Own keys only. An empty object means no override. Another runtime key is refused with the recovery.
//  3. A seat name matches ^[\w-]+$ and must be a seat file the manifest lists for that runtime. A name is only ever
//     compared with manifest paths; no path on disk is built from it.
//  4. Setting names are `model`, `effort` and `maxTurns` under claude, and `model` and `model_reasoning_effort`
//     under codex. A Codex seat file has no turn-limit slot, so no turn-limit name exists under codex. Anything
//     else is refused with the recovery.
//  5. `model`, `effort` and `model_reasoning_effort` are strings matching ^[A-Za-z0-9][\w.-]*$, the value grammar
//     admitted on a seat line. `maxTurns` is a JSON integer from 1 to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. In the settings
//     file a Claude `model` of `inherit` is refused, because it leaves the seat's model to the session, so the seat
//     policy could not be checked. A seatDefaults record may hold `inherit`: it records what the canonical shipped.
//  6. The seat file must carry that setting exactly once inside its settings block, in the plain form
//     (`model: value`, `maxTurns: 90`, `model = "value"`). An override changes a value; it cannot add a setting.
//  7. An override may not introduce a problem. The agent check and the seat policy are run on the shared bytes and
//     on the rendered bytes, and any problem reported for the rendered bytes and not for the shared bytes is a
//     refusal that quotes it and ends with this sentence:
//       a value only a newer copy of the shared workflow admits can be named after the sync that installs it
//  8. A manifest never lists the settings path. The comparison is the folded one the manifest already uses for its
//     own entries. A seatDefaults record obeys rules 2 to 5 and names only seat files the same manifest lists.
//  9. `runtimes`, when present, is a non-empty array naming `claude`, `codex` or both, each once; with no key both
//     runtimes are present. Anything else is refused. A seat named under a runtime the list leaves out is refused.
//
// The JSON half of rule 1 and the list half of rule 9 are readSettingsHeader (runtimes.mjs), which parseSettings
// calls; rules 2, 4, 5 and the seat half of rule 9 are parseSettings and seatsByPath; 6 is substituteSeatSettings; 7 is
// overrideProblems. The file half of rule 1, rule 3 and rule 8 belong to the sync.

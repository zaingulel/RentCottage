// issue-publish.mjs — pure checks for a published issue, with or without children.
//
// A board card can exist without a Status or routing value, and an issue can be
// linked in a body rather than as a native child. This verifier keeps publication
// honest: every named issue must be on the board with a real Status and, when
// board-config.mjs configures a routing field (Workstream here), a real routing
// value; a board with no routing field is checked for Status only. Given an Epic
// plus child numbers, its native children must be exactly that set — a count
// alone passes when a forgotten child is offset by a stray one. Given a single
// number, the count is reported rather than asserted, because a lone number
// cannot distinguish a standalone issue from an Epic whose children were
// forgotten: showing the count resolves that ambiguity visibly.

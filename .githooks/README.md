# Git hooks (committed, deterministic gates)

These hooks move the repository's most-repeated discipline rules off agent and human memory
and onto committed local gates, so a mistake is caught before it reaches a metered CI run.

| Hook | What it enforces | Bypass |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | One guard, scoped to what is staged: Claude Markdown and Codex TOML agent definitions must parse (blocks silently-dropped agents). One advisory, never blocking: `scripts/doc-lint.mjs --staged` reports prose rot in staged documents and skills. Then the product gate: an executable `scripts/gates/pre-commit`, when present, runs on every commit, and its non-zero exit, or a gate file that is not executable, blocks the commit. | `git commit --no-verify` |
| `pre-merge-commit` | Runs `pre-commit` on a merge that would auto-commit. A merge that auto-commits never runs `pre-commit`, so a merge driver that keeps one side of a generated artifact could otherwise commit it stale; this hook gives the product gate that case. | `git merge --no-verify` |
| `pre-push` | `npm run lint` (~1 s, skipped with a warning when eslint is missing) and the `scripts/lib` node:test suite (invoked as `node --test` directly so a missing npm cannot bypass it; fails closed on a missing node). Opt into the full Playwright suite with `RUN_TESTS=1 git push`. | `git push --no-verify` |

## Activation

Hooks live here (not in `.git/hooks/`) so they travel with the repository. They are wired via
`core.hooksPath`, set by the `prepare` npm script, which also registers any merge driver the
product declares in `.gitattributes`:

```bash
npm install        # runs `prepare`
```

To activate manually (or verify):

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
git config --get core.hooksPath        # → .githooks
```

CI does not rely on these hooks: it runs the same checks as explicit steps. The product's own
checks live in `scripts/gates/`.

# The board

Planned work lives on one board, read and moved by a small toolkit of scripts so that a card's column and its issue
cannot drift apart unnoticed. This page explains the columns, the toolkit, the board's own automation and how the
toolkit serves another board. This page is part of [the workflow guide](AI-WORKFLOW.md). Related:
[The life of one change](AI-WORKFLOW-job.md) for when a card moves, and
[Enforced or instructed](AI-WORKFLOW-enforcement.md) for what is automated and what is instructed.

## Mental model

The six columns read as four stages, the shape any GitHub Project reader can copy onto their own board:

| Stage | Columns |
|---|---|
| To-Do | Backlog, Ready |
| Active | In progress, In review |
| Wait | Awaiting push |
| Done | Done |

## How it works

The board is a GitHub Project with six columns: Backlog, Ready, In progress, Awaiting push, In review, Done.
Ready means startable in the next session with no missing owner decision, external dependency, or scheduled
date. Awaiting push is the gap between local review passing and push authorisation, before any push has
happened: a card there has legitimately produced no pull request yet.

### Reading and moving cards

[`scripts/board.mjs`](../scripts/board.mjs) lists the board and, from the same read, reports a card whose column
disagrees with its issue; closeout runs it in its strict mode. [`scripts/board-move.mjs`](../scripts/board-move.mjs)
moves a card and, on a board with a parked lane, parks a card in that lane or releases it; on a board with no parked
lane it refuses that request before making any `gh` call. The head of each script owns its modes and argument forms.

### The toolkit in another repository

The toolkit (`scripts/board.mjs`, `board-add.mjs`, `board-move.mjs`, `verify-issue-publish.mjs` and
`scripts/lib/board.mjs`, `board-rules.mjs`, `board-config.mjs`, `board-add.mjs`, `board-move.mjs`, `issue-publish.mjs`,
`gh-exec.mjs`, `cli-flags.mjs`) copies unchanged into another repository; only `scripts/lib/board-config.mjs` differs.
It holds the repository's own board values, and three of its settings let the copy serve a different kind of board: who
owns the project, a user or an organisation; which field routes a card, or none on a board that tracks Status alone; and
a lane that parks a card. A parked card keeps its column but is left out of the pick view, which lists it on its own
`Parked (<field>: <option>), not pickable:` line instead. A parked card in an in-flight column is not reported as a
claim with no closing pull request, since it waits on an answer from outside the session, while the blocked, unassigned
and epic checks still judge it. The board script's JSON output carries `parked` on every card, `false` on a board with
no parked lane. [`scripts/lib/board-config.mjs`](../scripts/lib/board-config.mjs) owns each setting's name, the values
it takes and what each value changes.

Every `gh` call the toolkit makes runs through one command prefix that the `BOARD_TOOLKIT_GH` environment variable can
replace. The gh-calling tests reach their stand-in through it (`scripts/lib/fake-gh.mjs` sets it), never through PATH,
because on Windows `execFile("gh")` runs only `gh.exe` and an extensionless stand-in on PATH would be skipped in favour
of live GitHub. [`scripts/lib/gh-exec.mjs`](../scripts/lib/gh-exec.mjs) owns the variable's format, its default and what
a malformed value does.

### The board's own automation

The project's Workflows page (the workflow icon in the project header, not the Settings sidebar) carries the
board's own automation, so no agent moves a card for these cases:

| Workflow | State | Setting | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-add to project | On | `is:issue is:open` on this repository | A new issue is visible on the board before anyone triages it by hand |
| Item added to project | On | Status: Backlog | A card added by automation lands in Backlog, the same column `to-issues` and `resume` add to |
| Auto-add sub-issues to project | Off | | Cross-repository sub-issues would join this board, but the scripts cannot read them; this repository's epic slices already arrive through Auto-add to project |
| Item closed | On | Status: Done | The terminal move to Done happens without an agent or network access at merge time; `moveCards` reads it back and skips its own write when this already ran |
| Auto-archive items | On | `is:issue,pr is:closed updated:<@today-2w` | Keeps the active board small; a Done card is archived, never deleted, so history stays intact |
| Pull request linked to issue | Off | | Awaiting push and In review are `resume`'s calls, tied to push authorisation and the draft actually opening, not merely a link existing |
| Pull request merged | Off | | The issue's own close, through the pull request's `Closes #` line, already triggers Item closed |
| Item reopened | Off | | A reopen is the Returned quality signal the session records deliberately; an automatic reversion would fight the Awaiting-push/In-review sequencing |
| Code changes requested | Off | | Review state is tracked by the `resume` skill's own evidence bar (fresh review, Greptile where required), not by the board |
| Code review approved | Off | | The same evidence bar as Code changes requested |
| Auto-close issue | Off | | Closing an issue follows the pull request's `Closes #` line, never inferred from a card's column |

### Proposals from the weekly retro

The weekly retro, in a repository that runs it, reaches the board the same way: it files proposal cards, the board's own
auto-add lands each in Backlog, and the next local session fills its routing value. It proposes and never edits, because
the fix for a recurring problem is a decision: the owner picks the card or closes it.
[`docs/WEEKLY-RETRO.md`](WEEKLY-RETRO.md) owns what the retro reads, how many proposals it may file and how each is
titled.

## Where the rules live

- [`docs/ISSUE-TRACKER.md`](ISSUE-TRACKER.md): the repository's tracker, how an issue joins the board, its routing
  convention and its labels.
- [`scripts/lib/board-config.mjs`](../scripts/lib/board-config.mjs): the repository's own board values, and the settings
  that let the scripts serve another board.
- The heads of [`scripts/board.mjs`](../scripts/board.mjs), [`scripts/board-add.mjs`](../scripts/board-add.mjs) and
  [`scripts/board-move.mjs`](../scripts/board-move.mjs): each script's modes and argument forms.
- [`scripts/lib/gh-exec.mjs`](../scripts/lib/gh-exec.mjs): the `BOARD_TOOLKIT_GH` contract.
- [The `resume` skill](../.agents/skills/resume/SKILL.md): when a session moves a card, and the candidate table the
  owner picks from.
- [The `closeout` skill](../.agents/skills/closeout/SKILL.md): the strict board check after a merge.
- [The `to-issues` skill](../.agents/skills/to-issues/SKILL.md): how new cards are proposed and filed.
- [`docs/WEEKLY-RETRO.md`](WEEKLY-RETRO.md): the weekly retro.

## Failure modes

- **A card's column disagrees with its issue.** For an issue's open-or-closed state, the scan reports a closed issue
  whose card is not in Done and an open issue whose card is in Done. An open issue whose closing pull request has merged
  is a reopen, not shipped work: it is judged by its open state and its column like any other open issue, never reported
  as shipped.
- **Automation adds a card with no routing value.** On a board with a routing field, a card that automation adds has no
  routing value; `scripts/board.mjs` reports it until the board-add script fills the field on the existing card, the
  value chosen by the convention in [`docs/ISSUE-TRACKER.md`](ISSUE-TRACKER.md).
- **Auto-add is off.** A board copied from another starts with Auto-add off; where it is off, every issue joins the
  board through the board-add script. [The head of `scripts/board-add.mjs`](../scripts/board-add.mjs) owns the
  invocation.

- `scripts/verify-issue-publish.mjs`: checks a published issue.
- `scripts/lib/board-config.mjs`: the one file that differs between repositories.
- `scripts/lib/gh-exec.mjs`: the one route every `gh` call takes.

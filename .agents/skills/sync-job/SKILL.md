description: Run a sync job, which copies the shared workflow files from the canonical repository into this repository. Use only when the job's card is a sync card.

# sync-job

`AGENTS.md` owns what is shared, where it is authored and when a sync card is opened, under "Shared workflow adoption";
this skill owns how a sync job runs, which cards it covers and how they close, how shared files are fingerprinted,
pinned and kept, and what a repository needs before it runs the workflow.

A sync card runs `node scripts/factory-sync.mjs --from <canonical checkout>` from the adopter's job worktree against a
clean canonical checkout at its fetched `main`. That run copies everything on the canonical `main`, so one sync job
resolves every open sync card in the adopter whose change it carried. The same run removes each file the adopter's
committed manifest listed and the canonical no longer shares, when the adopter's copy is committed and byte for byte
the one last synced, and prints it; anything else at such a path stops the run before it writes, naming the path. A
card is covered when `git merge-base --is-ancestor` shows its canonical merge commit is an ancestor of the canonical
commit the run copied from, and its acceptance criteria hold in the adopter; the job's pull request body lists each
covered card with that evidence. After the merge, the job's own card closes as completed and closeout closes each
covered card as not planned, with a comment naming the card that did the sync and quoting its evidence. A card whose
change merged after the run, or whose evidence the job cannot show, stays open.

**How shared files are kept.** The manifest's `canonical` repository authors each shared file under `src/` and keeps an
installed copy at its root in the same commit, fingerprinted with `node scripts/factory-sync.mjs --write`; a test in its
suite refuses a difference. Each repository in `adopters` holds a copy pinned at the commit its manifest records as
`syncedFrom`. A shared file edited without its manifest hash following fails the contract test; `--write` refreshes the
hashes, and only in the canonical repository. Shared files are real files, never symlinks, since a symlink reaches a
Windows checkout as plain text: a skill lives in `.agents/skills/` and is copied whole to `.claude/skills/`, and each
hook directory carries its own `.gitattributes` so hooks keep LF endings wherever line endings are converted; the
contract test fails on a symlink, a copy that differs from its source, or a missing rule. A git hook's run permission is
its committed file mode.

**How a repository overrides a seat.** Each seat file's setting lines, as the canonical repository ships them, are
the defaults: a model, an effort and a turn limit in a Claude seat file, and a model and an effort in a Codex seat
file, which carries no turn limit. An adopter that wants another value names the seat and the value in its seat
settings file, a committed file of its own that the manifest never lists and no tool writes; the head of
`scripts/lib/seat-settings.mjs` gives its path, its schema and what it refuses. `node scripts/factory-sync.mjs --render`
applies the file to the seat files and records each replaced default in the manifest, and every sync applies it again
to the fetched bytes, so a setting the adopter does not name follows the canonical's next retune and a named one stays.
The settings file, the seat files and the manifest are committed together; the contract test refuses a seat that
differs from the shared file anywhere but in a named value. An override changes a value the seat already carries. It
may raise or lower any seat's effort, put a cheaper model on a seat or lower a turn limit. It may never put the
costliest Claude or Codex model on a seat other than the ones `AGENTS.md` names for it under "Runtime notes", raise the
turn limit of the `oracle` or `security-reviewer` seat above 90, or leave a seat's model to the session with `inherit`;
the sync and `--render` refuse such a settings file before they write anything. Both judge only the values the settings
file names, with the copy of the workflow the repository has installed, so a value only a newer copy admits can be
named after the sync that installs it. Where a skill, a guide page or a seat's own description names a seat's model or
effort, it names the canonical default.

**How a repository names its runtimes.** The same settings file may carry `runtimes`, a list naming `claude`, `codex` or
both; without it the repository runs both. Everything shared under `.claude/`, and `CLAUDE.md`, belongs to Claude Code;
everything under `.codex/` to Codex; `scripts/lib/runtimes.mjs` names the few scripts tied to each; every other shared
file belongs to every install. A sync writes only the named runtimes' files and keeps every entry in the manifest, so
`--check` still compares like with like. The contract test requires each path of a runtime the file leaves out to hold
nothing and refuses anything found there, and the agent check reads only the named runtimes' seats, comparing the
reviewer charters only where both run. To stop running a runtime, remove its seat overrides and run `--render`, name the
remaining runtime, commit, then sync: the sync removes each of the other runtime's files that holds exactly the bytes it
recorded and refuses, by name, one that holds anything else. To start running one, name it, commit and sync.

**What a repository needs.** The supported profiles are Claude Code alone, Codex alone, or both with cross-family
review; nothing installs the workflow for a customer. It needs a private repository whose default branch is `main`, the
two branch rulesets with the administrator bypass of the required check that the direct documentation route depends on,
the required `test` check, the board, `npm ci` for the hooks, and each runtime having trusted the repository's hooks,
since a hook file a runtime has not trusted does not run. A repository that runs one runtime makes three changes of its
own, which no sync carries. It removes its own files of the other runtime. It leaves the other runtime's hook folder out
of the `lint` script in its `package.json`. And its document lint command, `scripts/doc-lint.mjs`, accepts a path
reference, link or `CLAUDE.md` citation whose target `installs` in `scripts/lib/runtimes.mjs` says the repository does
not install, and reads `CLAUDE.md` only where Claude Code runs; its `scripts/lib/doc-lint.test.mjs` then copies
`scripts/lib/runtimes.mjs` into the scratch repository it builds. The shared documents still name both runtimes, and the
shared link and citation tests apply the same rule themselves.
